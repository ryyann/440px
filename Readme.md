# 440px
We've all been there, browsing popular image upload service 500px, looking at their
collection of beautiful, high resolution images and thought:

> "Wow, this is a great picture, but it's just too dang big! If only it was exactly
 440px by 440px ðŸ˜¤"

Well you're in luck friendo because have I got an app for you! Introducing 440px,
the best way to view exactly the same content as on 500px but smaller (and thus better).
There's even a watermark added!

## Development
440px is built with [neutrino](https://neutrino.js.org) to simplify bundling and
development. To get started:

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
$ open http://localhost:4000
```
